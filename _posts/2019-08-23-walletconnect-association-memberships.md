title: Announcing WalletConnect Association call for Members
---
The WalletConnect Association was created just over one year ago as WalletConnect Verein, a Swiss Association.

The mission of the WalletConnect Association is to enable the broad usage of digital assets and identity by everyone. We accomplish this through the following goals:

1. Developing WalletConnect technical standards in an open and collaborative way
1. Partnerships with related technical and marketing organizations with the same goal of digital asset usage across all blockchains
1. Research, promotion, and marketing around best practices for end-to-end user experience around digital assets

## Join as an Associate Member

We are inviting people & organizations to join the association!

This initial call for memberships is open to all who want to help build the association and define its governance, priorities, and investments moving forward.

We will be working on paid membership tiers, who will have increase benefits and responsibilities. Please contact us if you're interested in hearing more.
